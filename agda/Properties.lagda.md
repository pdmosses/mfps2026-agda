# Postulated Properties

The [postulated domain notation] declares domain constructors and their associated operations,
which we use in our embedding of conventional denotational semantic definitions in Agda.
The corresponding `Properties` modules postulate basic properties of some of the associated operations.

The postulated properties presented below support proofs that denotations compute the expected values
These properties are expected to hold in various categories of domains,
but they do *not* define the *mathematical structure* of domains.

When postulated properties are declared as *rewrite rules*,
Agda can use them *automatically* in proofs.
Agda also has an option to check that the declared rewrite rules form a confluent system.
Rewrite rules are safe to use with `Agda.Builtin.Equality` when that option is enabled.
Confluent but non-terminating rewrite rules cannot break consistency
[(Cockx2021TRT)].
The rewrite rules declared in the modules imported below support *automatic* proof
of all the illustrative tests: the proof terms are simply `refl` (i.e., reflexivity).
```agda
--"hide"
{-# OPTIONS --rewriting --confluence-check #-}

--"/hide"
module Properties where
  import Properties.Functions
  import Properties.Flat
  import Properties.Recursion
```
Removing any of the rewrite rules in the above modules
would break the proof for at least one of our tests of the `LC` and `PCF` examples.
Further modules with postulated properties will be needed when
tests for equivalence of denotations of `Scm` expressions are added.

Rewrite rules are safe to use with `Agda.Builtin.Equality` when that option is enabled
In principle, all `refl` proof terms that rely on rewrite rules could be replaced by proofs
that apply the postulated properties to specified subterms.
However, we expect that it would be quite tedious to develop such proofs,
and reading them is unlikely to provide new insights.
```agda
--"hide"
  import Properties.Flat.Booleans
  import Properties.Flat.Naturals
  import Properties.Sums
  import Properties.Products
  import Properties.Products.Tuples
  import Properties.Products.Sequences
  import Properties.Updates
--"/hide"
