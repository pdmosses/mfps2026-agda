# Sequence Domains

The domain `D ⋆` of finite sequences of elements of a domain `D` is
conventionally written $D^*$.

The following notation for the various operations on sequences was introduced
in the early 1970s, and is used in the *Scheme* semantics [(Scheme)].
(The single angle-brackets `⟨...⟩` used to form sequences are unrelated to the
double angle-brackets `⟪ D ⟫` used for the carrier of domain `D`.)
